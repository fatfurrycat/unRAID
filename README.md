unRAID plugins developed by fatfurrycat

Currently, there is only the new v5 native unRAID plugin for minidlna.
This brings with it a new unRAID v5 friendly GUI, and the latest version of minidlna (v1.1).

Many thanks go to Rich Manton (overbyrn) for allowing me to use lots of the code from his DenyHosts plugin for unRAID.
